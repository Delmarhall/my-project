                        You might feel that purchasing an electric vehicle is costlier than buying an internal
                        combustion engine vehicle, but that is only because of the higher
                        upfront cost. Effective cost over the lifetime for electric vehicles is still less. The
                        government offers different types of financial incentives to make electric vehicles more
                        affordable for you. The key mechanisms for getting incentives are:
