                            Every new technology follows an economic path where the initial upfront price is higher. This reaches a maximum and then decreases when people adopt this technology commonly. Electric vehicles are the same, but the higher price points are quickly changing as the costs go down. To help with high initial costs, many subsidies and incentives are offered by the government.

Fast chargers are mainly used to charge electric 4-wheelers with bigger batteries.
